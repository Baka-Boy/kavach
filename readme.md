Important Notes
While our women's safety app could be a useful tool for many women, it's important to remember that not everyone has a smartphone or has access to one. Therefore, we recommend considering other options, such as:

Emergency hotlines: Many countries have dedicated emergency hotlines that women can call in case of an emergency. These hotlines are usually toll-free and can be accessed from any phone, including landlines.
Safe transportation: Women can use safe transportation options such as designated women-only taxi services or public transportation that has separate sections for women.
Pre-existing Apps
We also recognize that there are other women's safety apps available that offer similar features. Here are some of the pre-existing apps that you may want to consider:
